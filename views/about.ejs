               <p>I am a passionate developer with a strong interest in creating professional-level applications using Flutter. My journey in app development began with a fascination for Flutter's capability to build beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Over time, I have honed my skills in Flutter to create visually stunning and highly functional apps.

                Beyond my proficiency in Flutter, I have a solid background in backend development. I am highly skilled in using Node.js and Express.js to create robust and scalable server-side applications. This combination of frontend and backend expertise allows me to develop comprehensive, end-to-end solutions that are efficient and reliable.</p>
